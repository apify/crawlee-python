To run Crawlee on your computer, ensure you meet the following requirements:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9 or higher installed,
2. [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed.

You can verify these by running the following commands:

```sh
python --version
```

```sh
pip --version
```

## Installation

Crawlee is available as the [`crawlee`](https://pypi.org/project/crawlee/) PyPI package. To install the core package, use:

```sh
pip install crawlee
```

After installation, verify that Crawlee is installed correctly by checking its version:

```sh
python -c 'import crawlee; print(crawlee.__version__)'
```

Crawlee offers several optional features through package extras. You can choose to install only the dependencies you need or install everything if you don't mind the package size.

### Install all features

If you do not care about the package size, install Crawlee with all features:

```sh
pip install 'crawlee[all]'
```

### Installing only specific extras

Depending on your use case, you may want to install specific extras to enable additional functionality:

#### BeautifulSoup

For using the [`BeautifulSoupCrawler`](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/BeautifulSoupCrawler), install the `beautifulsoup` extra:

```sh
pip install 'crawlee[beautifulsoup]'
```

#### Parsel

For using the [`ParselCrawler`](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/ParselCrawler), install the `parsel` extra:

```sh
pip install 'crawlee[parsel]'
```

#### Curl impersonate

For using the [`CurlImpersonateHttpClient`](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/CurlImpersonateHttpClient), install the `curl-impersonate` extra:

```sh
pip install 'crawlee[curl-impersonate]'
```

#### Playwright

If you plan to use a (headless) browser with [`PlaywrightCrawler`](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/PlaywrightCrawler), install Crawlee with the `playwright` extra:

```sh
pip install 'crawlee[playwright]'
```

After installing the playwright extra, install the necessary Playwright dependencies:

```sh
playwright install
```

### Installing multiple extras

You can install multiple extras at once by using a comma as a separator:

```sh
pip install 'crawlee[beautifulsoup,curl-impersonate]'
```

## With Crawlee CLI

The quickest way to get started with Crawlee is by using the Crawlee CLI and selecting one of the prepared templates. First, ensure you have [Pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) installed:

```sh
pipx --help
```

Then, run the CLI and choose from the available templates:

```sh
pipx run crawlee create my-crawler
```

If you already have `crawlee` installed, you can spin it up by running:

```sh
crawlee create my-crawler
```
