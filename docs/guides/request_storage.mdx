This guide explains the different types of request storage available in Crawlee, how to store the requests that your crawler will process, and which storage type to choose based on your needs.

## Request providers overview

All request storage types in Crawlee implement the same interface - <ApiLink to="class/RequestProvider">`RequestProvider`</ApiLink>. This unified interface allows them to be used in a consistent manner, regardless of the storage backend. The request providers are managed by storage clients - subclasses of <ApiLink to="class/BaseStorageClient">`BaseStorageClient`</ApiLink>. For instance, <ApiLink to="class/MemoryStorageClient">`MemoryStorageClient`</ApiLink> stores data in memory while it can also offload them to the local directory. Data are stored in the following directory structure:

```text
{CRAWLEE_STORAGE_DIR}/{request_provider}/{QUEUE_ID}/
```
:::note

Local directory is specified by the `CRAWLEE_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable with default value `./storage`. `{QUEUE_ID}` is the name or ID of the specific request storage. The default value is `default`, unless we override it by setting the `CRAWLEE_DEFAULT_REQUEST_QUEUE_ID` environment variable.

## Request queue

The <ApiLink to="class/RequestQueue">`RequestQueue`</ApiLink> is the primary storage for URLs in Crawlee, especially useful for deep crawling. It supports dynamic addition and removal of URLs, making it ideal for recursive tasks where URLs are discovered and added during the crawling process (e.g., following links across multiple pages). Each Crawlee project has a **default request queue**, which can be used to store URLs during a specific run. The <ApiLink to="class/RequestQueue">`RequestQueue`</ApiLink> is highly useful for large-scale and complex crawls.

The following code demonstrates the usage of the <ApiLink to="class/RequestQueue">`RequestQueue`</ApiLink>:

<Tabs groupId="request_queue">
    <TabItem value="request_queue_basic_example" label="Basic usage" default>
        <CodeBlock className="language-python">
            {RqBasicExample}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="request_queue_with_crawler" label="Usage with Crawler">
        <CodeBlock className="language-python">
            {RqWithCrawlerExample}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="request_queue_with_crawler_explicit" label="Explicit usage with Crawler" default>
        <CodeBlock className="language-python">
            {RqWithCrawlerExplicitExample}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Request list

The <ApiLink to="class/RequestList">`RequestList`</ApiLink> is a simpler, lightweight storage option, used when all URLs to be crawled are known upfront. It represents the list of URLs to crawl that is stored in a crawler run memory (or optionally in default <ApiLink to="class/KeyValueStore">`KeyValueStore`</ApiLink> associated with the run, if specified). The list is used for the crawling of a large number of URLs, when we know all the URLs which should be visited by the crawler and no URLs would be added during the run. The URLs can be provided either in code or parsed from a text file hosted on the web. The <ApiLink to="class/RequestList">`RequestList`</ApiLink> is typically created exclusively for a single crawler run, and its usage must be explicitly specified.

:::warning

The <ApiLink to="class/RequestList">`RequestList`</ApiLink> class is in its early version and is not fully
implemented. It is currently intended mainly for testing purposes and small-scale projects. The current
implementation is only in-memory storage and is very limited. It will be (re)implemented in the future.
For more details, see the GitHub issue [crawlee-python#99](https://github.com/apify/crawlee-python/issues/99).
For production usage we recommend to use the <ApiLink to="class/RequestQueue">`RequestQueue`</ApiLink>.

:::

The following code demonstrates the usage of the <ApiLink to="class/RequestList">`RequestList`</ApiLink>:

<Tabs groupId="request_list">
    <TabItem value="request_list_basic_example" label="Basic usage" default>
        <CodeBlock className="language-python">
            {RlBasicExample}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="request_list_with_crawler" label="Usage with Crawler">
        <CodeBlock className="language-python">
            {RlWithCrawlerExample}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Request-related helpers

We offer several helper functions to simplify interactions with request storages:

- The <ApiLink to="class/AddRequestsFunction">`add_requests`</ApiLink> function allows you to manually add specific URLs to the configured request storage. In this case, you must explicitly provide the URLs you want to be added to the request storage.
- The <ApiLink to="class/EnqueueLinksFunction">`enqueue_links`</ApiLink> function is designed to find new URLs in the current page and add them to the request storage. You can specify different enqueue strategies or add excluding / including filters to limit the URLs that will be added to the request storage. See [Crawl website with relative links](../examples/crawl-website-with-relative-links) for more details.

<Tabs groupId="request_helpers">
    <TabItem value="request_helper_add_requests" label="Add requests" default>
        <CodeBlock className="language-python">
            {RsHelperAddRequestsExample}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="request_helper_enqueue_links" label="Enqueue links">
        <CodeBlock className="language-python">
            {RsHelperEnqueueLinksExample}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Cleaning up the storages

By default, storages are automatically purged before the crawler starts, unless explicitly configured otherwise, for that case, see <ApiLink to="class/Configuration#purge_on_start">`Configuration.purge_on_start`</ApiLink>. This cleanup happens as soon as a storage is accessed, either when you open a storage (e.g. using <ApiLink to="class/RequestQueue#open">`RequestQueue.open`</ApiLink>) or when interacting with a storage through one of the helper methods (e.g. <ApiLink to="class/AddRequestsFunction">`add_requests`</ApiLink> or <ApiLink to="class/EnqueueLinksFunction">`enqueue_links`</ApiLink>, which implicitly opens the configured storage).

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {RsDoNotPurgeExample}
</CodeBlock>

If you do not explicitly interact with storages in your code, the purging will occur automatically when the <ApiLink to="class/BasicCrawler#run">`BasicCrawler.run`</ApiLink> method is invoked.

If you need to purge storages earlier, you can call <ApiLink to="class/MemoryStorageClient#purge_on_start">`MemoryStorageClient.purge_on_start`</ApiLink> directly. This method triggers the purging process for the underlying storage implementation you are currently using.

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {RsPurgeExplicitlyExample}
</CodeBlock>
