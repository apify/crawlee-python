import ApiLink from '@site/src/components/ApiLink';

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

import GoogleFunctions from '!!raw-loader!./code_examples/google/google_example.py';

## Updating the project

For the project foundation, use <ApiLink to="class/BeautifulSoupCrawler">BeautifulSoupCrawler</ApiLink> as described in this [example](../examples/beautifulsoup-crawler).

Add [functions-framework](https://pypi.org/project/functions-framework/) to your dependencies file `requirements.txt`. If you're using a project manager like `poetry` or `uv`, export your dependencies to `requirements.txt`.

Update the project code to make it compatible with Cloud Functions and return data in JSON format. Also add an entry point that Cloud Functions will use to run the project.

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {GoogleFunctions.replace(/^.*?\n/, '')}
</CodeBlock>

You can test your project locally. Start the server by running:

```bash
functions-framework --target=crawlee_run
```

Then make a GET request to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`, for example in your browser.

## Deploying to Google Cloud Platform

In the Google Cloud dashboard, create a new function, allocate memory and CPUs to it, set region and function timeout.

When deploying, select **"Use an inline editor to create a function"**. This allows you to configure the project using only the Google Cloud Console dashboard.

Using the `inline editor`, update the function files according to your project. **Make sure** to update the `requirements.txt` file to match your project's dependencies.

Also, make sure to set the **Function entry point** to the name of the function decorated with `@functions_framework.http`, which in our case is `crawlee_run`.

After the Function deploys, you can test it by clicking the "Test" button. This button opens a popup with a `curl` script that calls your new Cloud Function. To avoid having to install the `gcloud` CLI application locally, you can also run this script in the Cloud Shell by clicking the link above the code block.
