title: Crawl all links on website
---

import ApiLink from '@site/src/components/ApiLink';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This example uses the <ApiLink to="class/EnqueueLinksFunction">`enqueue_links`</ApiLink> helper to add new links to the <ApiLink to="class/RequestQueue">`RequestQueue`</ApiLink> as the crawler navigates from page to page. By automatically discovering and enqueuing all links on a given page, the crawler can systematically scrape an entire website. This approach is ideal for web scraping tasks where you need to collect data from multiple interconnected pages.

:::tip

If no options are given, by default the method will only add links that are under the same subdomain. This behavior can be controlled with the `strategy` option. You can find more info about this option in the [Crawl website with relative links](./crawl-website-with-relative-links) example.
