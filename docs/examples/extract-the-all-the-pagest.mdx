Analysis
Once both code snippets are executed:

Performance Metrics:

Time taken to complete the crawl.
Number of successful requests vs. errors.
Amount of data extracted.
Error Handling:

Handling of timeouts and unexpected errors.
Logging quality and usefulness.
Data Extraction:

Accuracy and completeness of the data extracted.
Additional data fields (links, meta description) in the improved snippet.
I'll run both snippets and then provide a detailed comparison and the most optimized code based on the findings.

Since I'm unable to run the code snippets directly in this environment, I'll guide you through the process of running and comparing them on your local machine.

Steps to Run and Compare the Code Snippets
Set Up Your Environment:

Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install crawlee playwright
Run the Original Code:

Save the original code in a file, e.g., original_crawler.py.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python original_crawler.py
Check the results.json file and logs to verify the output.
Run Improved Code Snippet 1:

Save the improved code snippet in another file, e.g., improved_crawler_1.py.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python improved_crawler_1.py
Again, check the results.json file and logs for the output.
Analyze and Compare:

Performance: Note the time taken for each script to complete the crawl.
Error Handling: Check the logs for any errors and how they were handled.
Data Extraction: Compare the data in results.json from both runs. Look for:
The number of entries.
The completeness of each entry (e.g., presence of links and meta_description in the improved snippet).
Expected Improvements in Improved Code Snippet 1
Enhanced Data Extraction:

The improved snippet extracts additional data fields such as links and meta descriptions.
Better Error Handling:

The snippet handles timeouts and logs errors more robustly.
Increased Requests per Crawl:

The limit is increased from 5 to 10 requests, potentially increasing data coverage.
Headless Mode:

Running in headless mode (headless=True) improves performance in production environments.

is adding a load balancer or some trvresa proxy techniques will enhance it
ChatGPT
Adding a load balancer or using reverse proxy techniques can enhance the performance and reliability of your web crawler, especially if you're dealing with a high volume of requests or need to distribute the load across multiple instances. Here are some ways you can leverage these techniques:

1. Load Balancer
   A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring no single server becomes a bottleneck. It can help with:

Scaling: Distributing the crawling tasks across multiple instances of your crawler.
Redundancy: Ensuring that if one instance fails, the others can continue processing requests.
Performance: Reducing the load on individual instances, leading to faster response times.
Example Setup:

Using Nginx as a Load Balancer:

nginx
Copy code
upstream crawler_backend {
server crawler_instance1:8000;
server crawler_instance2:8000;
server crawler_instance3:8000;
}

server {
listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://crawler_backend;
    }

}
In this setup, Nginx distributes incoming requests to multiple crawler instances running on different ports or hosts. 2. Reverse Proxy
A reverse proxy sits in front of your backend servers and forwards client requests to the appropriate server. It can provide:

Caching: Reduce the load on the backend by caching responses.
SSL Termination: Handle SSL encryption, offloading this task from the backend.
Security: Hide the backend servers from direct access and provide a single point of entry.
Example Setup:

Using Traefik as a Reverse Proxy:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3'

services:
traefik:
image: traefik:v2.4
command: - "--api.insecure=true" - "--providers.docker=true" - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
ports: - "80:80" - "8080:8080"
volumes: - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
networks: - web

crawler:
image: your_crawler_image
labels: - "traefik.http.routers.crawler.rule=Host(`crawler.local`)"
networks: - web

networks:
web:
external: true
Traefik will route requests to your crawler service based on the hostname.
Implementation Steps
Dockerize Your Crawler:

Ensure your crawler is containerized so it can be easily scaled and managed by the load balancer or reverse proxy.
Deploy Multiple Instances:

Deploy multiple instances of your crawler service. You can use Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or other orchestration tools.
Configure Load Balancer/Reverse Proxy:

Set up a load balancer or reverse proxy (like Nginx, Traefik, HAProxy) to distribute the load across your crawler instances.
Monitor and Scale:

Use monitoring tools to track the performance of your instances and scale up or down based on the load.
Example Docker Compose Setup with Traefik
Here's a complete example using Docker Compose and Traefik:

docker-compose.yml:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3.8'

services:
traefik:
image: traefik:v2.4
command: - "--api.insecure=true" - "--providers.docker=true" - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
ports: - "80:80" - "8080:8080"
volumes: - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
networks: - web

crawler_instance1:
image: your_crawler_image
labels: - "traefik.http.routers.crawler1.rule=Host(`crawler.local`)"
networks: - web

crawler_instance2:
image: your_crawler_image
labels: - "traefik.http.routers.crawler2.rule=Host(`crawler.local`)"
networks: - web

networks:
web:
external: true
Summary:

By adding a load balancer or using reverse proxy techniques, you can improve the scalability, reliability, and performance of your web crawler. This setup allows you to handle more requests concurrently and provides a more robust solution for production environments.

how to know how much the folder size and the performance of the code
ChatGPT
To measure the folder size and performance of your code, you can use various tools and techniques. Below are methods for both tasks:

1. Measuring Folder Size
   You can measure the folder size using different tools and commands depending on your operating system.

On Linux/MacOS:

Use the du command:

bash
Copy code
du -sh /path/to/your/folder
-s: Display only the total size.
-h: Human-readable format (e.g., 1K, 234M, 2G).
On Windows:

You can use the Get-ChildItem command in PowerShell:

powershell
Copy code
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum
Or, to get a human-readable format:

powershell
Copy code
(Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum / 1MB 2. Measuring Code Performance
To measure the performance of your Python code, you can use:

Time Module: For basic timing.
Timeit Module: For more precise timing.
cProfile Module: For profiling the entire script to see where time is spent.
Basic Timing with Time Module
You can use the time module to measure the execution time of your code.

python
Copy code
import time

start_time = time.time()

# Your code to measure

main()

end_time = time.time()
print(f"Execution Time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
Precise Timing with Timeit Module
For more accurate measurements, especially for small code snippets, use the timeit module.

python
Copy code
import timeit

def your_function(): # Your code to measure
main()

execution_time = timeit.timeit(your_function, number=1)
print(f"Execution Time: {execution_time} seconds")
Profiling with cProfile Module
For detailed profiling, use the cProfile module.

python
Copy code
import cProfile

cProfile.run('main()')
This will print a detailed report showing how much time was spent in each function.

Integrating Performance Measurement into Your Script
You can integrate the performance measurement directly into your script. Here’s how you can combine both the time module for overall timing and cProfile for detailed profiling:

python
Copy code
import asyncio
import time
import cProfile
import pstats
from crawlee.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawler, PlaywrightCrawlingContext

async def main() -> None:
start_time = time.time()

    crawler = PlaywrightCrawler(

    )

    async def request_handler(context: PlaywrightCrawlingContext) -> None:
        context.log.info(f'Processing {context.request.url} ...')
        await context.enqueue_links()
        data = {
            'url': context.request.url,
            'title': await context.page.title(),
            'content': (await context.page.content())[:100],
        }
        await context.push_data(data)

    await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev'])
    await crawler.export_data('results.json')
    data = await crawler.get_data()
    crawler._logger.info(f'Extracted data: {data.items}')

    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Execution Time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

if **name** == '**main**':
cProfile.run('asyncio.run(main())', 'profile_output')

analyze them first before making any changes

ChatGPT
Let's analyze the provided code snippets for **main**.py and routers.py before making any changes.

**main**.py
This script serves as the entry point for the crawler application. It uses the PlaywrightCrawler class from the crawlee library to initialize and run the crawler with a specific request handler and URL list.

python
Copy code
import asyncio
from crawlee.playwright_crawler.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawler
from .routes import router

async def main() -> None:
"""The crawler entry point."""
crawler = PlaywrightCrawler(
request_handler=router,
max_requests_per_crawl=50, # The crawler will process a maximum of 50 requests per run.
)

    await crawler.run(
        [
            'https://https://fady.gitbook.io/micro-services-deployments-to-digitalocean',
        ]
    )

if **name** == '**main**':
asyncio.run(main())
Analysis of **main**.py
Imports:

asyncio: Used to run the main function asynchronously.
PlaywrightCrawler from crawlee.playwright_crawler: The crawler class used to define and run the crawling process.
router from routes: The request handler imported from another module.
Main Function:

Initializes a PlaywrightCrawler instance with a specified request handler (router) and a maximum of 50 requests per crawl.
Runs the crawler with a list of initial URLs (note that the provided URL seems to have a typo with duplicate "https://").
routes.py
This script defines the routing logic for the crawler, specifically how requests are handled and processed.

python
Copy code
from crawlee.basic_crawler import Router
from crawlee.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawlingContext

router = Router[PlaywrightCrawlingContext]()

@router.default_handler
async def default_handler(context: PlaywrightCrawlingContext) -> None:
"""Default request handler."""
title = await context.page.query_selector('title')
await context.push_data(
{
'url': context.request.loaded_url,
'title': await title.inner_text() if title else None,
}
)

    await context.enqueue_links()

Analysis of routes.py
Imports:

Router from crawlee.basic_crawler: A router to manage request handlers.
PlaywrightCrawlingContext from crawlee.playwright_crawler: Provides context for each crawling request.
Router Initialization:

Creates a Router instance specifically for PlaywrightCrawlingContext.
Default Handler:

Defines an asynchronous function default_handler to process each request.
Extracts the page title and pushes the URL and title to the dataset.
Enqueues additional links found on the page for further crawling.
Issues and Improvements
URL Typo:

The URL in the main.py script has a typo: 'https://https://fady.gitbook.io/micro-services-deployments-to-digitalocean'. It should be corrected.
Error Handling:

The default_handler lacks error handling. Any errors during extraction or enqueuing should be caught and logged.
Performance Monitoring:

Adding performance monitoring and logging to measure execution time and resource usage would be beneficial.
Revised Code with Improvements
Let's revise the code to address these issues and enhance performance and reliability.

Revised **main**.py:

python
Copy code
import asyncio
import time
import cProfile
import pstats
from crawlee.playwright_crawler.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawler
from .routes import router

async def main() -> None:
"""The crawler entry point."""
start_time = time.time()

    crawler = PlaywrightCrawler(
        request_handler=router,
        max_requests_per_crawl=50,
    )

    await crawler.run(
        [
            'https://fady.gitbook.io/micro-services-deployments-to-digitalocean',
        ]
    )

    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Execution Time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

if **name** == '**main**':
cProfile.run('asyncio.run(main())', 'profile_output')

    # To view the profiling stats
    p = pstats.Stats('profile_output')
    p.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(10)

Revised routes.py:

python
Copy code
from crawlee.basic_crawler import Router
from crawlee.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawlingContext
from playwright.async_api import TimeoutError as PlaywrightTimeoutError

router = Router[PlaywrightCrawlingContext]()

@router.default_handler
async def default_handler(context: PlaywrightCrawlingContext) -> None:
"""Default request handler."""
try:
title_element = await context.page.query_selector('title')
title = await title_element.inner_text() if title_element else None

        await context.push_data(
            {
                'url': context.request.loaded_url,
                'title': title,
            }
        )

        await context.enqueue_links()
    except PlaywrightTimeoutError:
        context.log.error(f"Timeout while processing {context.request.url}")
    except Exception as e:
        context.log.error(f"Error processing {context.request.url}: {str(e)}")

Summary of Changes
Fixed URL Typo:

Corrected the URL in **main**.py.
Added Performance Monitoring:

Measured the execution time using the time module.
Added profiling using cProfile for detailed performance analysis.
Added Error Handling:

Included error handling in routes.py to catch and log exceptions during page processing.
By implementing these changes, the code becomes more robust, easier to monitor, and potentially more performant.

itls extracting injason already but i want a better jason format
ChatGPT
To improve the JSON format, you can enhance the data extraction logic to include more structured information. This involves adding more details about the extracted data and organizing it into a more readable and meaningful format.

Here's an updated version of the code to produce a better JSON format:

Revised **main**.py:
python
Copy code
import asyncio
import time
import cProfile
import pstats
from crawlee.playwright_crawler.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawler
from .routes import router

async def main() -> None:
"""The crawler entry point."""
start_time = time.time()

    crawler = PlaywrightCrawler(
        request_handler=router,
        max_requests_per_crawl=50,
    )

    await crawler.run(
        [
            'https://fady.gitbook.io/micro-services-deployments-to-digitalocean',
        ]
    )

    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Execution Time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

if **name** == '**main**':
cProfile.run('asyncio.run(main())', 'profile_output')

    # To view the profiling stats
    p = pstats.Stats('profile_output')
    p.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(10)

Revised routes.py:
python
Copy code
from crawlee.basic_crawler import Router
from crawlee.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawlingContext
from playwright.async_api import TimeoutError as PlaywrightTimeoutError

router = Router[PlaywrightCrawlingContext]()

@router.default_handler
async def default_handler(context: PlaywrightCrawlingContext) -> None:
"""Default request handler."""
try: # Wait for the content to load
await context.page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')

        # Extract the title and meta description
        title_element = await context.page.query_selector('title')
        title = await title_element.inner_text() if title_element else None
        meta_description_element = await context.page.query_selector('meta[name="description"]')
        meta_description = await meta_description_element.get_attribute('content') if meta_description_element else None

        # Extract all links on the page
        links = await context.page.evaluate('Array.from(document.links).map(link => link.href)')

        # Structure the extracted data
        data = {
            'url': context.request.loaded_url,
            'title': title,
            'meta_description': meta_description,
            'links': links,
            'content_snippet': (await context.page.content())[:500],  # Include a content snippet for context
        }

        await context.push_data(data)
        await context.enqueue_links()
    except PlaywrightTimeoutError:
        context.log.error(f"Timeout while processing {context.request.url}")
    except Exception as e:
        context.log.error(f"Error processing {context.request.url}: {str(e)}")

Changes Made:
Detailed Extraction:

Added extraction of the meta description.
Extracted all links on the page.
Included a content snippet of the page for more context.
Structured Data:

Organized the extracted data into a more detailed and structured JSON format.
Error Handling:

Added error handling to ensure any issues during extraction are logged.
Running the Code
After running the script, the JSON output will be more structured and detailed. The new JSON structure will look like this:

json
Copy code
[
{
"url": "https://fady.gitbook.io/micro-services-deployments-to-digitalocean",
"title": "Micro-Services Deployments to DigitalOcean",
"meta_description": "Learn how to deploy micro-services to DigitalOcean.",
"links": [
"https://link1.com",
"https://link2.com",
...
],
"content_snippet": "This is a snippet of the page content for context. ..."
},
...
]
This structure provides more context and is easier to understand, making it more useful for further analysis or processing.

Import "playwright.async_api" could not be resolvedPylancereportMissingImports
ChatGPT
To resolve the playwright.async_api import issue, you need to ensure you have the Playwright package installed correctly and that your development environment is set up to recognize it. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install Playwright
   First, make sure you have Playwright installed. You can do this using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install playwright 2. Install Playwright Browsers
After installing Playwright, you need to install the browsers that Playwright supports:

bash
Copy code
playwright install 3. Verify Your Environment
Ensure that your Python environment is correctly set up and that your IDE or code editor is using the correct interpreter.

4. Correct Import Statement
   Sometimes, issues with import resolution can be resolved by checking the package structure. The correct import for Playwright's async API is:

python
Copy code
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, TimeoutError as PlaywrightTimeoutError
Updated Code
Here's the updated version of the routes.py with the correct import statement:

**main**.py:
python
Copy code
import asyncio
import time
import cProfile
import pstats
from crawlee.playwright_crawler.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawler
from .routes import router

async def main() -> None:
"""The crawler entry point."""

        [
            'https://fady.gitbook.io/micro-services-deployments-to-digitalocean',
        ]
    )

    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Execution Time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

if **name** == '**main**':
cProfile.run('asyncio.run(main())', 'profile_output')

    # To view the profiling stats
    p = pstats.Stats('profile_output')
    p.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(10)

routes.py:
python
Copy code
from crawlee.basic_crawler import Router

from playwright.async_api import TimeoutError as PlaywrightTimeoutError

router = Router[PlaywrightCrawlingContext]()

@router.default_handler
async def default_handler(context: PlaywrightCrawlingContext) -> None:
"""Default request handler."""
try: # Wait for the content to load
await context.page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')

        # Extract the title and meta description
        title_element = await context.page.query_selector('title')
        title = await title_element.inner_text() if title_element else None
        meta_description_element = await context.page.query_selector('meta[name="description"]')
        meta_description = await meta_description_element.get_attribute('content') if meta_description_element else None

        # Extract all links on the page
        links = await context.page.evaluate('Array.from(document.links).map(link => link.href)')

        # Structure the extracted data
        data = {
            'url': context.request.loaded_url,
            'title': title,
            'meta_description': meta_description,
            'links': links,
            'content_snippet': (await context.page.content())[:500],  # Include a content snippet for context
        }

        await context.push_data(data)
        await context.enqueue_links()
    except PlaywrightTimeoutError:
        context.log.error(f"Timeout while processing {context.request.url}")
    except Exception as e:
        context.log.error(f"Error processing {context.request.url}: {str(e)}")

Additional Tips
Restart Your IDE:
Sometimes, restarting your IDE (like VSCode or PyCharm) can resolve import issues, as it refreshes the environment.

Check Python Path:
Ensure that your IDE is using the correct Python interpreter where Playwright is installed. You can set this in the settings of your IDE.

Virtual Environment:
If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated in your terminal or IDE.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import issue and run the code with the enhanced JSON format.

This short tutorial will help you start scraping with Crawlee in just a minute or two. For an in-depth understanding of how Crawlee works, check out the [Introduction](../introduction/index.mdx) section, which provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide to creating your first scraper.

## Choose your crawler

Crawlee offers two main crawler classes: BeautifulSoupCrawler, and PlaywrightCrawler. All crawlers share the same interface, providing maximum flexibility when switching between them.

### BeautifulSoupCrawler

The BeautifulSoupCrawler is a plain HTTP crawler that parses HTML using the well-known [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) library. It crawls the web using an HTTP client that mimics a browser. This crawler is very fast and efficient but cannot handle JavaScript rendering.

### PlaywrightCrawler

The PlaywrightCrawler uses a headless browser controlled by the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) library. It can manage Chromium, Firefox, Webkit, and other browsers. Playwright is the successor to the [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) library and is becoming the de facto standard in headless browser automation. If you need a headless browser, choose Playwright.

:::caution before you start

Crawlee requires Python 3.9 or later.

:::

## Installation

Crawlee is available as the [crawlee](https://pypi.org/project/crawlee/) PyPI package.

sh
pip install crawlee

Additional, optional dependencies unlocking more features are shipped as package extras.

If you plan to use BeautifulSoupCrawler, install crawlee with beautifulsoup extra:

sh
pip install 'crawlee[beautifulsoup]'

If you plan to use PlaywrightCrawler, install crawlee with the playwright extra:

sh
pip install 'crawlee[playwright]'

Then, install the Playwright dependencies:

sh
playwright install

You can install multiple extras at once by using a comma as a separator:

sh
pip install 'crawlee[beautifulsoup,playwright]'

## Crawling

Run the following example to perform a recursive crawl of the Crawlee website using the selected crawler.

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="BeautifulSoupCrawler" label="BeautifulSoupCrawler">

python
import asyncio

from crawlee.beautifulsoup_crawler import BeautifulSoupCrawler, BeautifulSoupCrawlingContext

async def main() -> None: # BeautifulSoupCrawler crawls the web using HTTP requests and parses HTML using the BeautifulSoup library.
crawler = BeautifulSoupCrawler(max_requests_per_crawl=50)

    # Define a request handler to process each crawled page and attach it to the crawler using a decorator.
    @crawler.router.default_handler
    async def request_handler(context: BeautifulSoupCrawlingContext) -> None:
        # Extract relevant data from the page context.
        data = {
            'url': context.request.url,
            'title': context.soup.title.string if context.soup.title else None,
        }
        # Store the extracted data.
        await context.push_data(data)
        # Extract links from the current page and add them to the crawling queue.
        await context.enqueue_links()

    # Add first URL to the queue and start the crawl.
    await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev'])

if **name** == '**main**':
asyncio.run(main())

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="PlaywrightCrawler" label="PlaywrightCrawler">

python
import asyncio

from crawlee.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawler, PlaywrightCrawlingContext

async def main() -> None: # PlaywrightCrawler crawls the web using a headless browser controlled by the Playwright library.
crawler = PlaywrightCrawler()

    # Define a request handler to process each crawled page and attach it to the crawler using a decorator.
    @crawler.router.default_handler
    async def request_handler(context: PlaywrightCrawlingContext) -> None:
        # Extract relevant data from the page context.
        data = {
            'url': context.request.url,
            'title': await context.page.title(),
        }
        # Store the extracted data.
        await context.push_data(data)
        # Extract links from the current page and add them to the crawling queue.
        await context.enqueue_links()

    # Add first URL to the queue and start the crawl.
    await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev'])

if **name** == '**main**':
asyncio.run(main())

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you run the example, you will see Crawlee automating the data extraction process in your terminal.

{/* TODO: improve the logging and add here a sample */}

## Running headful browser

By default, browsers controlled by Playwright run in headless mode (without a visible window). However, you can configure the crawler to run in a headful mode, which is useful during development phase to observe the browser's actions. You can alsoswitch from the default Chromium browser to Firefox or WebKit.

python

# ...

async def main() -> None:
crawler = PlaywrightCrawler( # Run with a visible browser window.
headless=False, # Switch to the Firefox browser.
browser_type='firefox'
)

    # ...

When you run the example code, you'll see an automated browser navigating through the Crawlee website.

{/* TODO: add video example */}

## Results

By default, Crawlee stores data in the ./storage directory within your current working directory. The results of your crawl will be saved as JSON files under ./storage/datasets/default/.

To view the results, you can use the cat command:

sh
cat ./storage/datasets/default/000000001.json

The JSON file will contain data similar to the following:

json
{
"url": "https://crawlee.dev/",
"title": "Crawlee · Build reliable crawlers. Fast. | Crawlee"
}

:::tip

If you want to change the storage directory, you can set the CRAWLEE_STORAGE_DIR environment variable to your preferred path.

:::

This short tutorial will help you start scraping with Crawlee in just a minute or two. For an in-depth understanding of how Crawlee works, check out the [Introduction](../introduction/index.mdx) section, which provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide to creating your first scraper.

## Choose your crawler

Crawlee offers two main crawler classes: BeautifulSoupCrawler, and PlaywrightCrawler. All crawlers share the same interface, providing maximum flexibility when switching between them.

### BeautifulSoupCrawler

The BeautifulSoupCrawler is a plain HTTP crawler that parses HTML using the well-known [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) library. It crawls the web using an HTTP client that mimics a browser. This crawler is very fast and efficient but cannot handle JavaScript rendering.

### PlaywrightCrawler

The PlaywrightCrawler uses a headless browser controlled by the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) library. It can manage Chromium, Firefox, Webkit, and other browsers. Playwright is the successor to the [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) library and is becoming the de facto standard in headless browser automation. If you need a headless browser, choose Playwright.

:::caution before you start

Crawlee requires Python 3.9 or later.

:::

## Installation

Crawlee is available as the [crawlee](https://pypi.org/project/crawlee/) PyPI package.

sh
pip install crawlee

Additional, optional dependencies unlocking more features are shipped as package extras.

If you plan to use BeautifulSoupCrawler, install crawlee with beautifulsoup extra:

sh
pip install 'crawlee[beautifulsoup]'

If you plan to use PlaywrightCrawler, install crawlee with the playwright extra:

sh
pip install 'crawlee[playwright]'

Then, install the Playwright dependencies:

sh
playwright install

You can install multiple extras at once by using a comma as a separator:

sh
pip install 'crawlee[beautifulsoup,playwright]'

## Crawling

Run the following example to perform a recursive crawl of the Crawlee website using the selected crawler.

<Tabs groupId="main">
<TabItem value="BeautifulSoupCrawler" label="BeautifulSoupCrawler">

python
import asyncio

from crawlee.beautifulsoup_crawler import BeautifulSoupCrawler, BeautifulSoupCrawlingContext

async def main() -> None: # BeautifulSoupCrawler crawls the web using HTTP requests and parses HTML using the BeautifulSoup library.
crawler = BeautifulSoupCrawler(max_requests_per_crawl=50)

    # Define a request handler to process each crawled page and attach it to the crawler using a decorator.
    @crawler.router.default_handler
    async def request_handler(context: BeautifulSoupCrawlingContext) -> None:
        # Extract relevant data from the page context.
        data = {
            'url': context.request.url,
            'title': context.soup.title.string if context.soup.title else None,
        }
        # Store the extracted data.
        await context.push_data(data)
        # Extract links from the current page and add them to the crawling queue.
        await context.enqueue_links()

    # Add first URL to the queue and start the crawl.
    await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev'])

if **name** == '**main**':
asyncio.run(main())

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="PlaywrightCrawler" label="PlaywrightCrawler">

python
import asyncio

from crawlee.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawler, PlaywrightCrawlingContext

async def main() -> None: # PlaywrightCrawler crawls the web using a headless browser controlled by the Playwright library.
crawler = PlaywrightCrawler()

    # Define a request handler to process each crawled page and attach it to the crawler using a decorator.
    @crawler.router.default_handler
    async def request_handler(context: PlaywrightCrawlingContext) -> None:
        # Extract relevant data from the page context.
        data = {
            'url': context.request.url,
            'title': await context.page.title(),
        }
        # Store the extracted data.
        await context.push_data(data)
        # Extract links from the current page and add them to the crawling queue.
        await context.enqueue_links()

    # Add first URL to the queue and start the crawl.
    await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev'])

if **name** == '**main**':
asyncio.run(main())

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you run the example, you will see Crawlee automating the data extraction process in your terminal.

{/* TODO: improve the logging and add here a sample */}

## Running headful browser

By default, browsers controlled by Playwright run in headless mode (without a visible window). However, you can configure the crawler to run in a headful mode, which is useful during development phase to observe the browser's actions. You can alsoswitch from the default Chromium browser to Firefox or WebKit.

python

# ...

async def main() -> None:
crawler = PlaywrightCrawler( # Run with a visible browser window.
headless=False, # Switch to the Firefox browser.
browser_type='firefox'
)

    # ...

When you run the example code, you'll see an automated browser navigating through the Crawlee website.

{/* TODO: add video example */}

## Results

By default, Crawlee stores data in the ./storage directory within your current working directory. The results of your crawl will be saved as JSON files under ./storage/datasets/default/.

To view the results, you can use the cat command:

sh
cat ./storage/datasets/default/000000001.json

The JSON file will contain data similar to the following:

json
{
"url": "https://crawlee.dev/",
"title": "Crawlee · Build reliable crawlers. Fast. | Crawlee"
}

:::tip

If you want to change the storage directory, you can set the CRAWLEE_STORAGE_DIR environment variable to your preferred path.

Explanation
main.py: This script initializes a PlaywrightCrawler instance with a specified router for handling requests. It runs a crawl on a single URL and measures execution time using time.time().

router.py: This script defines a Router instance for PlaywrightCrawlingContext and a default request handler default_handler. The handler waits for page load, extracts title, meta description, links, and a content snippet. It then structures this data and pushes it to the context for further processing.

Ensure that your directory structure and imports match your project setup. This setup should integrate smoothly with your Crawlee project to initiate and handle crawling tasks effectively.

    )

    # Add more customization as needed
    # ...

    await crawler.run(['https://example.com'])
Viewing Results
By default, Crawlee stores data in the ./storage directory within your current working directory. Results of the crawl will be saved as JSON files under ./storage/datasets/default/.

To view the results, you can use commands like cat or open the JSON files directly:

sh
Copy code

This short tutorial will help you start scraping with Crawlee in just a minute or two. For an in-depth understanding of how Crawlee works, check out the [Introduction](../introduction/index.mdx) section, which provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide to creating your first scraper.

## Choose your crawler

Crawlee offers two main crawler classes: `BeautifulSoupCrawler`, and `PlaywrightCrawler`. All crawlers share the same interface, providing maximum flexibility when switching between them.

### BeautifulSoupCrawler

The `BeautifulSoupCrawler` is a plain HTTP crawler that parses HTML using the well-known [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) library. It crawls the web using an HTTP client that mimics a browser. This crawler is very fast and efficient but cannot handle JavaScript rendering.

### PlaywrightCrawler

The `PlaywrightCrawler` uses a headless browser controlled by the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) library. It can manage Chromium, Firefox, Webkit, and other browsers. Playwright is the successor to the [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) library and is becoming the de facto standard in headless browser automation. If you need a headless browser, choose Playwright.

:::caution Before You Start
Crawlee requires Python 3.9 or later.
:::

## Installation

Crawlee is available as the [`crawlee`](https://pypi.org/project/crawlee/) PyPI package.

```sh
pip install crawlee
Additional, optional dependencies unlocking more features are shipped as package extras.

If you plan to use BeautifulSoupCrawler, install crawlee with beautifulsoup extra:

sh
Copy code
pip install 'crawlee[beautifulsoup]'
If you plan to use PlaywrightCrawler, install crawlee with the playwright extra:

sh
Copy code
pip install 'crawlee[playwright]'
Then, install the Playwright dependencies:

sh
Copy code
playwright install
You can install multiple extras at once by using a comma as a separator:

sh
Copy code
pip install 'crawlee[beautifulsoup,playwright]'
Crawling
Run the following example to perform a recursive crawl of the Crawlee website using the selected crawler.

from crawlee.beautifulsoup_crawler import BeautifulSoupCrawler, BeautifulSoupCrawlingContext


async def main() -> None:
    # BeautifulSoupCrawler crawls the web using HTTP requests and parses HTML using the BeautifulSoup library.
    crawler = BeautifulSoupCrawler(max_requests_per_crawl=50)

    # Define a request handler to process each crawled page and attach it to the crawler using a decorator.
    @crawler.router.default_handler
    async def request_handler(context: BeautifulSoupCrawlingContext) -> None:
        # Extract relevant data from the page context.
        data = {
            'url': context.request.url,
            'title': context.soup.title.string if context.soup.title else None,
        }
        # Store the extracted data.
        await context.push_data(data)
        # Extract links from the current page and add them to the crawling queue.
        await context.enqueue_links()

    # Add first URL to the queue and start the crawl.
    await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev'])

When you run the example, you will see Crawlee automating the data extraction process in your terminal.

{/* TODO: improve the logging and add here a sample */}

Running headful browser
By default, browsers controlled by Playwright run in headless mode (without a visible window). However, you can configure the crawler to run in a headful mode, which is useful during development phase to observe the browser's actions. You can also switch from the default Chromium browser to Firefox or WebKit.

python
Copy code
# ...

async def main() -> None:
    crawler = PlaywrightCrawler(
        # Run with a visible browser window.
        headless=False,
        # Switch to the Firefox browser.
        browser_type='firefox'
    )

    # ...
When you run the example code, you'll see an automated browser navigating through the Crawlee website.

{/* TODO: add video example */}

Results
By default, Crawlee stores data in the ./storage directory within your current working directory. The results of your crawl will be saved as JSON files under ./storage/datasets/default/.

To view the results, you can use the cat command:

sh
Copy code
cat ./storage/datasets/default/000000001.json
The JSON file will contain data similar to the following:

json
Copy code
{
    "url": "https://fady.gitbook.io/micro-services-deployments-to-digitalocean",
    "title": "Micro Services Deployments to DigitalOcean"
}
If you want to change the storage directory, you can set the CRAWLEE_STORAGE_DIR environment variable to your preferred path.

        title_element = await context.page.query_selector('title')
        title = await title_element.inner_text() if title_element else None
        meta_description_element = await context.page.query_selector('meta[name="description"]')
        meta_description = await meta_description_element.get_attribute('content') if meta_description_element else None

        # Extract all links on the page
        links = await context.page.evaluate('Array.from(document.links).map(link => link.href)')

        # Structure the extracted data
        data = {

    except Exception as e:
        context.log.error(f"Error processing {context.request.url}: {str(e)}")
In this enhanced version, we have updated the main.py to include profiling and time measurement, and updated the router.py to handle request processing and error logging more effectively. This ensures better performance and reliability in your crawling tasks.
