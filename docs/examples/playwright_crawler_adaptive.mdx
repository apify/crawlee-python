import AdaptivePlaywrightCrawlerExample from '!!raw-loader!./code/adaptive_playwright_crawler.py';

This example demonstrates how to use <ApiLink to="class/AdaptivePlaywrightCrawler">`AdaptivePlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink>. An <ApiLink to="class/AdaptivePlaywrightCrawler">`AdaptivePlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink> is a combination of <ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink> and some implementation of HTTP-based crawler like <ApiLink to="class/ParselCrawler">`ParselCrawler`</ApiLink> or <ApiLink to="class/BeautifulSoupCrawler">`BeautifulSoupCrawler`</ApiLink>.
It uses more limited request handler interface so that it is able to switch to HTTP-only crawling when it detects it may be possible.

A **pre-navigation hook** can be used to perform actions before navigating to the URL. This hook provides further flexibility in controlling environment and preparing for navigation. Hooks will be executed both for the pages crawled by HTTP-bases sub crawler and playwright based sub crawler. Use `playwright_only`=`True` to mark hooks that should be executed only for playwright sub crawler.
