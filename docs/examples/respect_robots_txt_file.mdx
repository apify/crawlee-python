This example demonstrates how to configure your crawler to respect the rules established by websites for crawlers as described in the [robots.txt](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) file.

To configure `Crawlee` to follow the `robots.txt` file, set the parameter `respect_robots_txt_file=True` in <ApiLink to="class/BasicCrawlerOptions">`BasicCrawlerOptions`</ApiLink>. In this case, `Crawlee` will skip any URLs forbidden in the website's robots.txt file.

As an example, let's look at the website `https://news.ycombinator.com/` and its corresponding [robots.txt](https://news.ycombinator.com/robots.txt) file. Since the file has a rule `Disallow: /login`, the URL `https://news.ycombinator.com/login` will be automatically skipped.

The code below demonstrates this behavior using the <ApiLink to="class/BeautifulSoupCrawler">`BeautifulSoupCrawler`</ApiLink>:

<RunnableCodeBlock className="language-python" language="python">
    {RespectRobotsTxt}
</RunnableCodeBlock>
