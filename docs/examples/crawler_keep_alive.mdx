title: Keep a Crawler alive waiting for more requests

import ApiLink from '@site/src/components/ApiLink';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

import BeautifulSoupExample from '!!raw-loader!./code/beautifulsoup_crawler_keep_alive.py';

This example demonstrates how to keep crawler alive even when there are no requests at the moment by using `keep_alive=True` argument of <ApiLink to="class/BasicCrawler#__init__">`BasicCrawler.__init__`</ApiLink>. This is available to all crawlers that inherit from <ApiLink to="class/BasicCrawler">`BasicCrawler`</ApiLink> and in the example below it is shown on <ApiLink to="class/BeautifulSoupCrawler">`BeautifulSoupCrawler`</ApiLink>. To stop the crawler that was started with `keep_alive=True` you can call `crawler.stop()`.
