# {{cookiecutter.project_name}}

Project skeleton generated by Crawlee ({{ cookiecutter.crawler_type | capitalize }} template).

## Usage

{% if cookiecutter.package_manager == 'poetry' -%}
To get started, ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), a package and dependency management system, installed on your machine. We recommend installing it with the following command:

```sh
pipx install poetry
```

Next, install the project dependencies:

```sh
poetry install
```

Finally, launch the crawler with:

```sh
poetry run python -m {{cookiecutter.__package_name}}
```
{% elif cookiecutter.package_manager == 'pip' -%}
To install dependencies, your can run the following command:

```sh
pip install .
```

When the dependencies are installed, you may launch the crawler with:

```sh
python -m {{cookiecutter.__package_name}}
```
{% elif cookiecutter.package_manager == 'manual' -%}
You selected the manual dependency installation method, so you're on your own. There is a simple `requirements.txt` file to get you started.
