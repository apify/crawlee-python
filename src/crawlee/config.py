        system_info_interval: Defines the interval of emitting the `SystemInfo` event.

        max_used_cpu_ratio: Sets the ratio, defining the maximum CPU usage. When the CPU usage is higher than
            the provided ratio, the CPU is considered overloaded.

        max_used_memory_ratio: Sets the ratio, defining the maximum memory usage. When the memory usage is higher

        max_event_loop_delay: Sets the maximum delay of the event loop. When the delay is higher than the provided
            value, the event loop is considered overloaded.

        max_client_errors: Sets the maximum number of client errors (HTTP 429). When the number of client errors
