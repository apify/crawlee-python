class RequestQueue(Storage, RequestManager):
    """Request queue is a storage for managing HTTP requests.

    The request queue class serves as a high-level interface for organizing and managing HTTP requests
    during web crawling. It provides methods for adding, retrieving, and manipulating requests throughout
    the crawling lifecycle, abstracting away the underlying storage implementation details.

    Request queue maintains the state of each URL to be crawled, tracking whether it has been processed,
    is currently being handled, or is waiting in the queue. Each URL in the queue is uniquely identified
    by a `unique_key` property, which prevents duplicate processing unless explicitly configured otherwise.

    The class supports both breadth-first and depth-first crawling strategies through its `forefront` parameter
    when adding requests. It also provides mechanisms for error handling and request reclamation when
    processing fails.

    You can open a request queue using the `open` class method, specifying either a name or ID to identify
    the queue. The underlying storage implementation is determined by the configured storage client.

    ### Usage

    ```python
    from crawlee.storages import RequestQueue

    # Open a request queue
    rq = await RequestQueue.open(name='my_queue')

    # Add a request
    await rq.add_request('https://example.com')

    # Process requests
    request = await rq.fetch_next_request()
    if request:
        try:
            # Process the request
            # ...
            await rq.mark_request_as_handled(request)
        except Exception:
            await rq.reclaim_request(request)
    ```
