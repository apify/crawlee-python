class MemoryStorageClient(StorageClient):
    """Memory implementation of the storage client.

    This storage client provides access to datasets, key-value stores, and request queues that store all data
    in memory using Python data structures (lists and dictionaries). No data is persisted between process runs,
    meaning all stored data is lost when the program terminates.

    The memory implementation provides fast access to data but is limited by available memory and does not
    support data sharing across different processes. All storage operations happen entirely in memory with
    no disk operations.

    The memory storage client is useful for testing and development environments, or short-lived crawler
    operations where persistence is not required.
