class SystemStatus:
    """Provides a simple interface for evaluating system resource usage from snapshots collected by `Snapshotter`.

    This class aggregates and interprets snapshots from a Snapshotter instance to evaluate the current and historical
    status of system resources like CPU, memory, event loop, and client API usage. It exposes two methods
    `get_current_system_info` and `get_historical_system_info`. The system information is computed using a weighted
    average of overloaded messages in the snapshots, with the weights being the time intervals between the snapshots.
    Each resource is computed separately, and the system is considered as overloaded whenever at least one resource
    is overloaded.

    `get_current_system_info` returns a `SystemInfo` data structure that represents the current status
    of the system. The length of the current timeframe in seconds is configurable by the `max_snapshot_age` option
    and represents the max age of snapshots to be considered for the computation.

    `SystemStatus.get_historical_system_info` returns a `SystemInfo` that represents the long-term status of the system.
    It considers the full snapshot history available in the `Snapshotter` instance.
