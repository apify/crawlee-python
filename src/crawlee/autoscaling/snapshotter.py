class Snapshotter:
    """Creates snapshots of system resources at given intervals.

    Creates snapshots of system resources at given intervals and marks the resource as either overloaded or not during
    the last interval. Keeps a history of the snapshots. It tracks the following resources: Memory, EventLoop, API
    and CPU. The class is used by the `AutoscaledPool` class.

    When running on the Apify platform, the CPU and memory statistics are provided by the platform, as collected from
    the running Docker container. When running locally, `Snapshotter` makes its own statistics by querying the OS.

    CPU becomes overloaded locally when its current use exceeds the `maxUsedCpuRatio` option or when Apify platform
    marks it as overloaded.

    Memory becomes overloaded if its current use exceeds the `max_used_memory_ratio` option. It's computed using
    the total memory available to the container when running on the Apify platform and a quarter of total system
    memory when running locally. Max total memory when running locally may be overridden by using
    the `CRAWLEE_MEMORY_MBYTES` environment variable.

    Event loop becomes overloaded if it slows down by more than the `max_blocked` option.

    Client becomes overloaded when rate limit errors (429 - Too Many Requests) exceeds the `max_client_errors` option,
    typically received from the request queue, exceed the set limit within the set interval.
